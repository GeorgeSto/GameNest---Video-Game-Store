# GameNest - Video Game Store

As a Software Design project, I'm implementing a game store. I want to divide this store into several categories to make it easier for buyers to find a game much faster respecting everyone's desire.


## Features

- A customer must create an account in order to purchase a game
- There will be an admin who takes care of the whole site and another person who can add games
- A capable search bar that anyone can use to find games by title.
- It will be possible to add, delete, update the stock of games
- The user can save his favorite game category to find future games more easily 


## Tech

- [Java] - for the backend implementation
- [SpringBoot] - framework for the project
- [MySQL] - database handling
